# Automated Report Labeling
ARL - automated report labeling is a tool I developed to increase team productivity for some specific tasks required by the company.

# How to setup environment

This was designed to be used by Linux/MacOS users. On your Home folder create the following folder

* Reports
* Reports/pdfs

# Downloading ARL

clone this repository on your HOME folder by typing this on the terminal:

`git clone https://github.com/cacpmw/automated-report-labeling.git`

# Organizing files to be labeled

Put all the files you want to be labeled inside `~/Reports/pdfs`. As of this moment ONLY WOUND ASSESSMENT AND SUPERBILLS can be relabeled.
